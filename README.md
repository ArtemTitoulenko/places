# Distributed Airport Locator Service

This collection of servers and a client allows a user to find the five nearest airports to a place. There is a list of places that is not updated and will not be updated.

## Installation

In either `AirportServer` or `PlaceServer`, run:

	$ go get

This should install the `code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/proto` package which is obviously a protobuffer package for Go.

## Running the PlaceServer

In the `PlaceServer` directory, you may either run:

	$ go run ./place-server.go

or you may compile the program and run it like so:

	$ go build
	$ ./PlaceServer

You can check what options are available by passing the `--help` flag. You should see something like:

	Usage:
		place-server [-p port]
	Defaults:
		-help=false: Print usage information
		-p=1080: The port on which to listen for connections
		-place-data="./placedata/places-proto.bin": Which places file to use
		-port=1080: The port on which to listen for connections

## Running the AirportServer

In the `AirportServer` directory, you may either run:

	$ go run ./airport-server.go

or you may compile the program and run it like so:

	$ go build
	$ ./AirportServer

You can check what options are available by passing the `--help` flag. You should see something like:

	Usage:
		airport-server [-p port]
	Defaults:
	  -airport-data="./airportdata/airports-proto.bin": Which airport location file to use
	  -help=false: Print usage information
	  -p=1082: The port on which to listen for connections
	  -port=1082: The port on which to listen for connections

## Running the Client

In the `Client` directory, you may either run:

	$ go run ./client.go

or you may compile the program and run it like so:

	$ go build
	$ ./Client

You can check what options are available by passing the `--help` flag. You should see something like:
	
	Usage:
		client [--place-host host] [--place-port port] [--airport-host host] [--airport-port port] [--help] [--kilometers] city state
	Defaults:
	  -airport-host="localhost": The AirportServer host
	  -airport-port=1082: The AirportServer listening port
	  -help=false: Print help
	  -kilometers=false: Display distances in kilometers
	  -place-host="localhost": The PlaceServer host
	  -place-port=1080: The PlaceServer listening port

### Usage

The Client application takes a city and a state as parameters and returns the five nearest airports, ordered by distancce. The units of measure default to miles but can be displayed in kilometers by passing the `--kilometers` flag. City names must be exact, and state's are denoted by their two-letter abbreviations.

An example run may look like:

	$ go run client.go "Abbeville city" AL
	Connecting to PlaceServer at localhost:1080
	Connecting to AirportServer at localhost:1082
	
	DHN: Dothan, AL distance: 20.65 miles
	OZR: Fort Rucker, AL distance: 33.96 miles
	TOI: Troy, AL distance: 49.78 miles
	MAI: Marianna, FL distance: 50.33 miles
	LSF: Fort Benning, GA distance: 54.74 miles

## Bugs and Discrepancies

There don't seem to be any bugs except small discrepancies between the distances computed using the given greater circle distance computation formula and the results obtained from Wolfram Alpha. These may be attributed to a loss of precision between the given dataset and the one used by Wolfram Alpha.

# Data Storage and Search

## PlaceServer

The place server stores all of the places in a large slice of type `[]*Place`. Retrieval of a place is done in linear time. No attemptes are made to clean input and find place names that may be a close match.

## AirportServer

The airport server stores all of the airports in a large slice of type `[]*Airport`. Retrieval of airports comprises of using a large `[]float64` slice to hold a list of distances to airports in increasing order, and a map of type `map[float64]*Airport` which maps a distance to an airport to an airport. This is a brute-force method that is most likely very inefficient but might be Good Enoughâ„¢ for the given load.

## Overcoming the Brute-force Inefficiency

Because the client application allows the user to specify not only the port but also a host for each server, a load balancer could be placed in front of a pool of either server type and requests could be sent to the pool either randomly or round-robin.
